The problem asks us to partition a singly linked list around a value
洧논
x, such that:

All nodes with values less than
洧논
x appear before nodes with values greater than or equal to
洧논
x.
The relative order of nodes within each partition must be preserved.
Approach
We can solve this by creating two separate lists:

Left Partition: Contains nodes with values less than
洧논
x.
Right Partition: Contains nodes with values greater than or equal to
洧논
x.
Finally, we combine these two lists to form the partitioned linked list.

Steps:
Create two dummy nodes, leftHead and rightHead, to serve as the heads of the two partitions.
Traverse the input list:
If a node's value is less than
洧논
x, add it to the left partition.
Otherwise, add it to the right partition.
After traversal, connect the two partitions.
Ensure the end of the right partition points to null.
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity:
洧녝
(
洧녵
)
O(n), where
洧녵
n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once.
Space Complexity:
洧녝
(
1
)
O(1), since we do not use extra space apart from pointers for partitioning.


Edge Cases
Empty List:
If the input list is empty, return null.
All Nodes <
洧논
x:
The right partition will be empty, and the result will be the same as the input list.
All Nodes >=
洧논
x:
The left partition will be empty, and the result will be the same as the input list.
This solution ensures the partitioning is done efficiently with
洧녝
(
1
)
O(1) space and preserves the relative order of nodes within each partition.
